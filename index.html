                     <p>
                        When she was 19 months old, Helen Keller (1880â€“1968) suffered a severe illness that left her blind and deaf.
						Not long after, she also became mute. Her tenacious struggle to overcome these handicaps-with the help of her 
						inspired teacher, Anne Sullivan-is one of the great stories of human courage and dedication. In this classic 
						autobiography, first published in 1903, Miss Keller recounts the first 22 years of her life, including the magical 
						moment at the water pump when, recognizing the connection between the word "water" and the cold liquid flowing over 
						her hand, she realized that objects had names. Subsequent experiences were equally noteworthy: her joy at eventually 
						learning to speak, her friendships with Oliver Wendell Holmes, Edward Everett Hale and other notables, her education 
						at Radcliffe (from which she graduated cum laude), and-underlying all-her extraordinary relationship with Miss Sullivan,
						who showed a remarkable genius for communicating with her eager and quick-to-learn pupil. (less)

                       This book is written in a simple manner and is very easy to understand. It describes the theory
					   with examples step by step. 
					   The book begins with an introduction to the language and explains the elements, 
					   input and output, and operator and expressions used in programming. Control statements, functions,
					   arrays, pointers, strings and files are covered next in successive chapters. Every chapter has examples in 
					   the form of programming that are explained step-wise. Five chapters have been added in the third edition, which includes 
					   chapters on Recursion and Bitwise Manipulation.Chapters on project development and 
					   library creation, code optimization, assembly interactions, and operations on bits may be helpful for further execution of the knowledge of programming.

                     <p>
							Data Structures Through C In Depth, published in 2011 by BPB Publications, is a textbook on 
							learning the C language meant for computer science students. This book, written in lucid and easy-to-understand 
							language, covers the basic concepts of Data Structures in C and contains ten chapters. The highlight of this book is 
							that it has been written as per the syllabus prescribed by different bodies, including the Indira Gandhi National Open University and 
							DOEACC Society. The book is useful for both beginners and advanced level students of C. Starting with an introduction to data structures, 
							the author explains basic concepts like arrays, pointers, and structures. Gradually, readers are exposed to other key topics like linked lists, 
							stack and queue, recursion, trees, sorting, graphs, searching, and hashing. These topics help students understand the programming concepts better.
							The author devotes an entire chapter to the concept of storage management, which is a very important aspect of learning the C language.

                        Dealing with computer architecture as well as computer organization and design,
						this fully updated book provides the basic knowledge necessary to understand the hardware 
						operation of digital computers. Written to aid electrical engineers, computer engineers, and 
						computer scientists, the volume includes: KEY FEATURES: the computer architecture, organization, 
						and design associated with computer hardware - the various digital components used in the organization
						and design of digital computers - detailed steps that a designer must go through in order to design an 
						elementary basic computer - the organization and architecture of the central processing unit - the organization 
						and architecture of input-output and memory - the concept of multiprocessing - two new chapters on pipeline and 
						vector processing -two sections devoted completely to the reduced instruction set computer (RISC) - and sample worked-out problems to clarify topics.
